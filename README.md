<h1>Project: Used Car Price Prediction</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project repository hosts code and resources for a used car price prediction endeavor, utilizing machine learning tools and the linear regression algorithm. It also features a frontend API developed with Streamlit for user interaction.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project encompasses details about various pre-owned vehicles, including attributes like Price, Kilometers Driven, Years, Car Model, Fuel Type, and more.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook (for code execution)</li>
  <li>Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
  <li>Streamlit (for running the frontend API)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<code>git https://github.com/botnet007/Used-Car-Price-Prediction-using-data-science.git

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>data/</code>: Contains the dataset used in the project.</li>
  <li><code>used_car_price_prediction.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training (linear regression), and evaluation.</li>
  <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: Specifies required Python libraries for easy installation.</li>
  <li><code>app.py</code>: Streamlit application for the frontend API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The linear regression-based machine learning model attained [insert performance metrics here] on the test set, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting used car prices.</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<p>Potential future enhancements for this project may involve:</p>
<ul>
